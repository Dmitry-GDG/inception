### CHECK:

1. clone git repo to shared folder in VM (virtual machine)

In a VM:

2. go to the shared folder -> open terminal -> drag "commands" file to the terminal -> inside terminal press Enter button

3. go to the shared folder -> in terminal

> make

Check containers:

> docker ps

> docker logs nginx

5. check mariadb

> docker exec -it mariadb bash
> mysql -utrurgot -ptrurgot
> status
> show databases;
> exit
> exit

Ðžpen browser in VM

6. check Adminer:

go to the localhost/adminer

(A self-signed certificate may appear. You must accept)
